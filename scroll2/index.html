                <h1 style="margin-top: 77.05;">The Ability to Work From Home is a Resiliency Strategy</h1>
                <p>By <a href = 'https://www.hraadvisors.com/team/kate-wittels/'>Kate Wittels</a></p>
                <p>
                    Working from home enables resilience for households, businesses and cities to withstand shocks, be them health, climate or safety related. As stay at home orders set in across the country, some Americans, usually those with more education and higher incomes, were able to easily transition to working from home. Whereas others, who were more likely black or brown, were unable to conduct their work virtually. For these Americans they either lost their source of income or were forced to expose themselves to COVID-19 in order to receive a paycheck. The stay at home orders have shed a spotlight on vast inequities that exist among different types of jobs â€“ those that can be conducted with a computer and high-speed internet and those that cannot.  As cities recover from COVID-19, investing in infrastructure, technology and training could enable more people to work from home, enabling a more just and resilient recovery.

                As we recover from COVID-19 and prepare for future shocks, policy makers need to consider how to increase the ability for more Americans to work from home. <br><br>To understand which occupations can work from home and which ones cannot, we evaluated the Occupational Information Network (O*NET) work activities profile to develop the following four categories of occupations:

                Bear in mind that some of these figures may suffer from small sample sizes. If you hover over a bubble, you can see additional information,
                including the number of students enrolled in a given major. Salary figures from degrees with lower 
                enrolment may be less accurate due to the smaller pool of student respondents

                <p>
                    If we rearrange all the data points into a histogram format, the salary potential of engineering majors becomes
                even more stark, as almost all the points on the right of the graph are colored yellow, for engineering. As for all the 
                other majors, they follow a fairly diverse yet tightly spaced distribution, with the modal class being
                salaries between $34,000 and $36,000.

                <h2>Does Gender Influence Chosen Majors?</h2>
                Now what if we took those same categories, but coloured them based on the proportion of the students which are male or female? 
                In this chart, blue represents majors with > 60% male, and red represents > 60% female, and the grey bubbles represent the more gender 
                balanced courses.
                <br><br>(Hover over the labels if you've forgotten the category)<br><br>

                What is striking about this graphic is that almost every category grouping of majors are either decidedly more female-weighted or male-weighted,
                with the exception of perhaps the business and physical sciences majors.

                When we plot the % of students in a major being female against the median salary of students in the major, a fairly clear trend emerges. 
                It appears that majors with a higher proportion of male students also produce students with higher median wages. <br><br> In fact, a linear model
                would predict that for every added percentage of female students in a given major, the median annual salary drops by $306 USD.

                So we've seen the most 'profitable' majors, as well as the ones with the most uneven gender distributions. But what are students 
                actually enrolling in the most frequently? What can enrolment numbers tell us about actual interest in each major? This chart has the bubbles 
                sized based on the number of students enrolled in each major, and coloured by category. 
                <svg id = 'legend3' width = '400px' height = '350px'></svg>
                Psychology is the clear leader in this regard, with over 390,000 students enrolled. Business related topics such as general business, business management,
                accounting and finance are all also heavily enrolled.
